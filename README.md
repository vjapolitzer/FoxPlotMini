# FoxPlotMini

Print 8 Idlers, 2 DrivePulleys, 2 YCarriages, and 1 of everything else. WireClips are optional. The ElectronicsMount assumes an Arduino Nano is used. It's what I had on hand, but I recommend an Uno instead for the larger usable flash space.
All screws are #4 machine screws, though M3 screws should work as a substitute.
Twelve 3/8" #4 screws and washers for mounting the IdlerMounts and MotorMounts, as well as the motors. Two more screws and washers for the ElectronicsMount if you use it. Six 1" #4 screws for the idlers, and ten washers, two of which go between the YCarriage idlers, the rest go on both sides of each idler. One nylon #6 screw is used to hold the pen in the holder, a steel one was used to tap the hole.
5mm rod for the motion. Two 200mm lengths for the Y-axis, two 235mm lengths for the X-axis, and two 35mm lengths for the pen sled.
I used two 4ft lengths of 3mm wide GT2 belt. Loop the ends around the XCarriage posts, and after tensioning, ziptie and cut excess belt.
A light rubber band applies pressure on the pen.
The HoleLayout PDFs help with hole alignment on the clipboard.
